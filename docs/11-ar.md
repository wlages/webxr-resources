# AR Mode

Certain devices will have optical or video see-through for AR. Enabling AR in our project requires two steps.

1-Initialize the AR mode
2-Remove the background (since the background will be the real world)

## Initializing AR

Enabling the AR mode is easy, simply modify the call to  "createDefaultXRExperienceAsync" to indicate an AR mode. It should look like the line below.

```javascript
const xr = await scene.createDefaultXRExperienceAsync({
	uiOptions: {sessionMode: 'immersive-ar'}
});
    
```

## Removing the background

To disable the background, remove or comment (put // in front) of these three lines:

```javascript
  //var hdrTexture = B.CubeTexture.CreateFromPrefilteredData(serverContentURL+"textures/skybox/skyEnvHDR.dds", scene);
   //hdrTexture.gammaSpace = false;
   //scene.createDefaultSkybox(hdrTexture, true, 10000);
```

## Making a smaller scene

It can be a bit hard to see the planetary system at once. So let's reduce it for the size of "tabletop" simulation.

Reduce the size of the models in "CreateScene" to:

-earth 0.2
-sun 0.5
-moon 0.05

In "CreatePlanet" reduce the size of the ring to:

- 0.1,0.1,0.1

In "StepSimulation" reduce the orbits to:

-er 1.0
-mr 0.3

also comment the call to MoveShip in "stepSimulation", so the sun is fixed instead of the earth (relatively speaking)

```javascript
 // MoveShip(earth, ship,t);
```

If you want to keep, make sure to reduce the ship orbit radius:

-sr 0.62
